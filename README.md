# Python-Challenge

I used a number of outside sources to help me with this assignment. I will list them below. In addition to these sources I also received help with some of the assignment during a tutoring session.

The sources I used were as followed:
    -https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-text-file/#:~:text=To%20write%20to%20a%20text%20file%20in%20Python%2C,close%20the%20file%20using%20the%20close%20%28%29%20method.

    -https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-index/
  
 The sources helped me with writing the text file and using the index, set, and min/max functions.
